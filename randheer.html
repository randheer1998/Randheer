       <p>CERN is not an isolated laboratory, but rather the focal point for 
        an extensive <a href="./randheer2.html">community</a> that includes more than 17 000 scientists from
         over 100 countries. Although they typically spend some time on the 
         CERN site, the scientists usually work at universities and national 
         laboratories in their homecountries.
        Reliable communication tools are therefore essential.</p>
